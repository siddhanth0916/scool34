        <p>At Sanskriti, we believe that a school is as good as a second home for the child. We strive to ensure that we create an atmosphere that is homely - without compromising on the quality of education and also to be the ideal school for your child. We primarily focus on teaching 3V's with the knowledge to make our students all-rounder.The 3Vs stand for - Value, Virtue, and Vision. We want our students to learn ethical Values, assimilate Virtuous traits, and have a positive mind ,compelling Vision of their future. </p>

        <p>At Sanskriti Schools, itâ€™s always a pleasure to address young minds. Children are our tomorrow - our future. Bright faces that I see here today receiving prizes and evincing their talents will be the citizens of tomorrow<br>Vikranth Terala</p>

        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>here is always a story behind every step taken towards improvement. The future of our nation lies in the hands of our children. To impart quality education is crucial from an early stage. After observing a dire need for value education and holistic learning methodology during the time, we established Sanskriti The School in 2009 under the Terala Educational Society. The board members are renowned personalities who laid the school foundation, with the intention to provide quality education and wholesome amenities to children from their early childhood. It is a platform for kids to enhance their social, secular, and ethical reasoning skills. </p>
